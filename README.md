## About

I am a Ph.D. researcher in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vermont, specializing in **mechanical and phononic metamaterials, wave propagation, and topological phononic band structures**. My work combines:

- Analytical modeling of lattice systems (including long-range coupling and topological edge states),
- Finite-element and multiscale simulations,
- Experimental validation using 3D-printed prototypes and laser vibrometry.

I am particularly interested in using **engineered materials to control mechanical and acoustic waves** for applications such as **noise and vibration control, structural health monitoring, and energy/heat management**. I also work with **data science and machine learning** tools to extract structure–property relationships from complex physical systems.

## Research & Technical Focus

- **Mechanical / Phononic Metamaterials**: Design and analysis of lattices with nontrivial band topology, in-gap edge and domain-wall states, and beyond–nearest-neighbor interactions.
- **Wave Propagation & Vibration**: Band structure calculations, dispersion analysis, and localization phenomena in periodic and quasi-periodic media.
- **Computational Mechanics**: FEM-based vibrational and buckling analysis of micro- and nano-scale structures; nonlocal elasticity and couple-stress theories.
- **Data Science & ML in Engineering**: Predictive modeling and classification (e.g., soil properties, accident severity, environmental and biomedical data) using tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and R-INLA.
- **Experimental Methods**: Laser vibrometry, 3D printing of metamaterial structures, and validation of numerical models against measurements.
