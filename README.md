## Acoustic Engineer  

#### Technical Skills:  MATLAB, Python, FEM, Phononic Crystal  

## About Me  
I am a **Ph.D. researcher in Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of Vermont**, specializing in **metamaterials, phononic crystals, and wave propagation**. My research focuses on **topological phononic band structures, mechanical wave control, and computational solid mechanics**. With expertise in **finite element modeling (FEM), vibrational analysis, and machine learning applications in engineering**, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and experimentation.  

I have extensive experience in **computational modeling, laser vibrometry, and metamaterial fabrication**. My goal is to **develop novel metamaterial structures for applications in energy harvesting, wave filtering, and noise reduction**.
