## About Me  
Imagine a world where **materials control and manipulate waves** with precision—silencing unwanted noise, harvesting ambient vibrations for energy, or guiding sound and mechanical waves with zero loss. My research is dedicated to developing **intelligent metamaterials** that make this vision a reality, with applications in **aerospace, robotics, biomedical engineering, and renewable energy**.  

By integrating **finite element modeling (FEM), vibrational analysis, and machine learning**, I design **next-generation metamaterials** that enable **wave filtering, vibration isolation, and energy-efficient devices**. My expertise spans **computational modeling, laser vibrometry, and metamaterial fabrication**, ensuring that my theoretical innovations translate into practical solutions.  

Whether it's **self-adapting noise barriers**, **ultra-efficient energy harvesters**, or **precision-engineered waveguides**, my work pushes the boundaries of material science to shape the future of technology.
